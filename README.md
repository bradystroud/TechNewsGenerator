# SSW Tech News Generator

[![.NET](https://github.com/bradystroud/TechNewsGenerator/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bradystroud/TechNewsGenerator/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

This is a POC to see if AI could do a good job at generating tech news. I'm not convinced it can yet, but I'll continue
to work on the prompt.

## F5 Instructions

`dotnet run` ðŸ¤¯

## POC Results

There are a few steps to manually preparing the news:

1. Find articles - usually done by browsing Microsoft, GitHub, OpenAI, and other blogs.
2. Picking the most important ones - done by reading the articles and understanding the content.
2. Add notes for the presenter - done by reading and understanding articles, and finding the most important bits. Also
   add why it matters

| Step                            | Can it be automated? ðŸ¤–                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Get the articles             | Yes, using RSS feeds seems to be working ok.                                                                                                       |
| 2. Pick the most important ones | I'm using OpenAI API to do this but I feel this will always need manual help (e.g. Generate initial list with AI then human with add/remove links) |
| 3. Add notes for the presenter  | Not yet tested, but should be doable with AI                                                                                                       |

Overall, I am not convinced that this can be automated well.
