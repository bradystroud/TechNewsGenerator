# SSW Tech News Generator

This was a POC to see if AI could do a good job at generating tech news.

TLDR: No - It's not smart enough to determine what articles are worthy of Tech News

When I do the tech news, I make sure to use a range of articles from different topics with a focus on .NET, GitHub and AI.
